# Assetter
Assets manager for PHP. Allow manage CSS and JS files in website and its dependencies. Also allows refresh cache in browsers by adding revisions of loaded files. Assetter allows you to register namespaces for files paths fo better managing if required.

Assetter now allows You to load Your SASS and LESS styles directly to Your project, and compile them just-in-time and load compiled styles in the browser. You have to only register any of built-in plugins to enable this functionality (and install suggested composer packages).
